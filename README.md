# Onchain-Robot-Racing
RoboRacers is an onchain robot racing game fully written in Solidity. Players register robotic racers, upgrade their parts, and compete in deterministic races powered by smart contract logic.  Each race is verifiable and tamper-proof, using pseudorandom elements derived from block data.

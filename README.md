## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Register your robot**
    ```solidity
    registerRacer(speed, durability);
    ```
    - Speed + Durability must be ≤ 150

2. **Start a race**
    ```solidity
    startRace([robot1, robot2, ...]);
    ```

3. **Finish the race**
    ```solidity
    finishRace(raceId);
    ```
    - The contract calculates the winner based on stats + block randomness
